# Documentation for My Notes App

Overview
The **My Notes App** is a simple and beginner-friendly web application designed to help users create, manage, and organize their notes effectively. This project combines **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to provide a dynamic, interactive, and visually appealing experience. The app also supports **dark mode** for better usability in low-light conditions and uses **local storage** to ensure notes persist even after refreshing the page.

Features
The app includes several useful features:
Adding Notes: Users can quickly add notes by clicking the "Add Notes" button, typing their content into a form, and saving it.
Editing Notes: Notes can be updated by clicking the "Edit" button. Once changes are made, users can save the updated content.
Deleting Notes: Unwanted notes can be deleted easily by clicking the "Delete" button, followed by confirmation.
Dark Mode: The app allows users to toggle between light and dark themes to enhance readability in different environments.
Persistent Storage: Notes are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring they remain accessible even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the application, providing elements like buttons, textareas, and containers for notes.
CSS: Styles the app with a modern look, making it visually appealing and responsive for all devices. The design includes custom colors, buttons, and note cards with a professional layout.
1.JavaScript: Implements the app's functionality, including adding, editing, and deleting notes, saving data in local storage, and toggling dark mode.

How the App Works
When you open the app in a web browser, you see a clean interface with options to add notes or toggle between light and dark modes. The **"Add Notes"** button reveals a form where you can type your content. Once saved, the note appears as a card in the main area. Each note has options to edit or delete it. 

The **Dark Mode** feature allows users to switch themes by clicking a toggle button. This updates the app's background, text, and button colors for better visibility. 

All notes are saved in the browser's **local storage**, so they remain available even if the browser is refreshed or reopened.

Responsive Design
This project is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across various devices:
Desktop: The app displays notes in a grid layout for easy viewing.
Tablets*: The layout adjusts to ensure readability with appropriately sized elements.
*Mobile Phones**: The app adapts to smaller screens, stacking notes vertically and providing an optimized experience for touch input.

The responsiveness is achieved using **CSS Flexbox** and **media queries**, ensuring the app is user-friendly on all screen sizes.

 **Categorization**: Allow users to organize notes into categories or folders.
 **Cloud Sync**: Integrate cloud storage to enable access to notes across multiple devices
